DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING
What-Enhanced version of Recursion.
How to identify-To find that the problem can be solved using DP we can identify on the basis of two things:-
1)Choice is given to us in the problem like choose an item or not.
2)optimal solution is asked example maximum profit,minimum loss etc.
How to solve and DP problem--
1)Write a recursive function for the problem
2)Memoization
3)Top-down approach
you can choose any method between 2 and 3 both have the same time complexity.

UNBOUNDED KNAPSACK->Same as (0-1) Knapsack , the difference is only that the supply of items in unbounded kanpasack is unlimited.
